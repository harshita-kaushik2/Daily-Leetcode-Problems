Approach
The code solves the problem of finding the longest chain of pairs in an array, where each pair's second value is smaller than the first value of the next pair.

The dynamic programming (DP) approach employed here is analogous to the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem: dp[i] stores the length of the longest chain ending at index i.
By sorting pairs and iterating through them, the inner loop checks for pairs that can extend the current chain. The comparison pairs[j][1] < pairs[i][0] aligns with the LIS condition. 
Thus, by maximizing dp[i] using 1+dp[j], the code efficiently finds the longest increasing chain of pairs, akin to the LIS concept.

Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n^2) due to the nested loops
- Space complexity: O(n) due to the storage of the dp array.

Code
class Solution {
public:
    int findLongestChain(vector<vector<int>>& pairs) {
        int size = pairs.size();
        vector<int> dp(size,1);
        sort(pairs.begin(), pairs.end());

        for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            for(int j = 0 ; j < i; j++) {
                if( pairs[j][1] < pairs[i][0] ) {
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], 1+dp[j]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[size-1];
    }
};
